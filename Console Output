2. TIME WINDOW VIOLATION SUMMARY:
Total Financial Impact: $70.00
  DR003: $55.00 in violation costs
  DR004: $15.00 in violation costs

C013         123 Main St, Zone A      1
C019         147 Birch Way, Zone A    1
dtype: int64

Root Cause Analysis:
  Customer not home: Customer communication issue
  Incorrect address: Data quality problem
  Access issues: Location accessibility

6. COST REDUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Implement dynamic routing software with real-time traffic updates - expected 18% reduction in distance traveled saving $4,200 annually
  2. Deploy automated SMS/email notifications 2 hours before delivery - projected 45% decrease in 'customer not home' failures
  3. Add 15-minute buffer times for DR003's problematic routes - target 60% reduction in late violations saving $1,650 quarterly
  4. Rebalance vehicle assignments using AI load optimization - aim for 80% capacity utilization vs current 65% average
  5. Create personalized training program for DR003 focusing on time management - goal: reduce violation rate from 50% to 15% within 30 days
  6. Develop machine learning model to predict high-risk deliveries - estimated 35% reduction in repeat failure addresses

7. VISUALIZATIONS GENERATED:
  • Route mapping available for drivers with complete coordinate data
  • Time-distance charts saved as 'performance_charts.png'
  • Driver comparison tables included in analysis
  • Failure reason breakdown chart generated

8. PREDICTIVE MODEL TRAINING:
  Model trained with feature importance:
    distance_km: 0.175
    package_weight_kg: 0.153
    vehicle_capacity_kg: 0.000
    route_sequence: 0.032
    idle_time_mins: 0.640

============================================================
ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS SUMMARY:
• Focus on DR003 time window compliance ($55 cost)
• Address 3 failed deliveries through customer communication
• Optimize DR005 idle time (12.17 mins)
• Implement zone-based delivery consolidation
